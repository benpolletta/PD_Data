function PD_spikes_by_freq_individual_save(folder, prefix, channel_multipliers, spike_boundaries, band, no_cycles, min_secs_apart, min_prominence, min_prominences_flag)

% Script to save peaks in time series from carbachol data. To help in
% locating peaks, this script first finds peaks in band power, then locates
% peaks in the LFP (above a certain prominence cutoff) that are close to
% these peaks in band power.

% INPUTS:
% folder - folder name (string).
% prefix - prefix name (string).
% basetime - time of infusion/first laser on, in seconds (integer).
% channel_multipliers - searches for peaks in LFP if +1, troughs in LFP if
%   -1 (matrix, length = number of channels).
% spike_boundaries - times within which to search for peaks/troughs
%   (in seconds, integers).
% band - limits (in Hz) of band close to whose peaks spikes are sought, e.g. [1 4] (length 2 vector).
% band_label - name of band for saving figures, e.g. 'delta' (string).
% no_cycles - number of cycles to use for Morlet wavelets used to get band
%   power, linearly spaced from lowest frequency up to highest frequency, e.g. [3 4] (length 2 vector). 
% min_secs_aparts - minimum number of seconds separating consecutive peaks
%   (seconds, fload).
% min_prominence - prominence cutoff at which peaks are recognized as
% peaks. Prominence is the sum over a certain time window (given by
%   min_secs_apart) of the difference between the peak value and the
%   surrounding values.
% min_prominence_flag - 'std', if prominence cutoff is given in terms of 
%   z-scored prominence for all peaks (determined before peaks are excluded
%   by prominence), or '' if prominence cutoff is given in terms of raw
%   prominence (usually easier).
